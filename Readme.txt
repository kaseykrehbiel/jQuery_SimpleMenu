I created the simpleMenu plugin to be simple. Much simpler than other menus. It
takes an HTML-standard nested unordered list with standard links (see 
menu.html) and turns it into a drop-down menu like the ones you see on most 
sites these days.

I made the CSS as easy as possible (it's only 68 lines broken out) so you can 
change colors, sizes, etc. very easily.

If you enjoy this plugin please feel free to let me know at my e-mail address
listed above. Please also let me know if you have questions, comments,
suggestions, etc.

Thank you for using the jQuery simpleMenu plugin!
